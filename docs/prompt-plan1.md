# Planning and Architecture Prompt
- Plan with me, read files, be thorough
- If you're an Anthropic model, ultrathink!
- Below is a problem to think through, think of 5 architectures
- Assess them with their pros and cons and recommend the top two with reasons
- Use a system that ranks them out of 10, so 9/10 is a great solution and 1/10 is a poor solution
- I want solutions that are vastly different, we try to cover the universe of ideas in our 5 solutions so we can focus on the best ideas
- Remember to modify any contracts/schema/interfaces needed too, this is a pre-mvp repo, we prefer to design a a simpler architecture then add fixes onto fixes for a worse architecture
- Ask me any questions that clear ambiguity
